# Node.js Express Application

This is a Node.js application using the Express framework. It provides a basic API and serves as a template for building RESTful web services.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 14.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the application locally.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chiencse/geek.git
```
2. Install dependencies
Run the following command to install all the dependencies required for the app
```bash
npm install

```
3. Configure environment variables
Ensure that you configure any required environment variables for the app, such as database credentials or API keys. You can create a .env file in the root directory with variables like:
```bash
PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=yourdbname
```

4. Run the application
Start the application by running the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
This will start the Express app, which should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Alternatively, if you are in a development environment, you can use nodemon to automatically restart the server on file changes:
```bash
npm run dev
```
6. Swagger Documentation
This app includes Swagger for API documentation. Once the app is running, you can access the documentation at:
http://localhost:3000/api-docs


# Initialize the database
Usage
Start the development server and access project features:
```bash
node initDatabase.js
```
